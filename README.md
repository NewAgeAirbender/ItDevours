# ItDevours

A book logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data inthe app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

Takes user input and creates new books (with title and done properties) in the database. The user can then change the progress on the book or delete it from the database.
